# ACloudGuru-Automating-AWS

Code I created (re-created) while following the A Cloud Guru Automating AWS with Python Course

## 01-Weboton

Webotron is a script which will script a sync of a local directory to an S3 bucket, and optionally configure Route 53 and Cloudfront. This is a recreation of the script from the Automating Python course on A Cloud Guru.

### Features

Webotron now has the following features:

- You can
  - List bucket
  - List bucket contents
  - Create and set up a bucket
  - Sync a local directory tree to a bucket
